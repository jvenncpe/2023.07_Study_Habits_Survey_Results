Capstone project output from "SP201 Essential Excel Skills for Data Preparation and Analysis"
facilitated by Project SPARTA from Development Academy of the Philippines.

The course expects us to craft professional data visualizations and summaries using a variety of Excel functions for a strong and impactful presentation.

# Activity
In our final capstone, we were tasked with creating a chart to visually represent the results of our hypothesis testing. In my case, the specifics about the hypothesis testing can be located in the Week 4 Excel file. 
Following this, we'll determine the most fitting chart type for our data, housed within a separate worksheet titled 'CHART'.

*However, this marked the initial stages of the course, and the hypotheses formulated were at a foundational level as well as the visualizations.*






## Methodology Implementation
### The survey aims to gather information from respondents on the following details:

• location and settlement classification,

• their enjoyment of studying or learning,

• preferred learning materials,

• average daily time spent studying or learning,

• the average expenditure on studying or learning,

• preferred time for studying or learning, and

• the preferred location for studying or learning.




### Afterwards, basic visualizations were made according to:

• Stack Column for the "Distribution of Enjoyment of Studying/Learning" with settlement classification composition.

• Pie Chart for the "Preferred Time of the Day", i.e., Morning, Afternoon, Evening & Late-night

• Bar Chart for the "Average Daily Time Spent (hours) per "Time of the Day", i.e., Morning, Afternoon, Evening & Late-night

• Another Bar Charts for the "Preferred Studying/Learning Location" and,

• "Average Expenditure on Preferred Studying/Learning Materials"




## Results and Discussion

• The number of people enjoying studying/learning between urban and rural is, 19 and 15, respectively. That is 56% and 44% percentage distribution.

• The preferred studying/learning time is Morning.

• Overall average daily time spent on studying/learning is "1.80hrs".

• The preferred studying/learning location is "Home".

• Overall average expenditure on studying/learning is "₱783.67".
