# Study Habits Survey Results 

Capstone project output from "SP201 Essential Excel Skills for Data Preparation and Analysis"
facilitated by Project SPARTA from Development Academy of the Philippines.

The course expects us to craft professional data visualizations and summaries using a variety of Excel functions for a strong and impactful presentation.

## Activity
We were assigned to develop a chart that visually illustrates the outcomes of our hypothesis testing. Detailed information regarding the hypothesis testing can be found under the 'Week 4' tab in the Excel file.

Subsequently, we will identify the most suitable chart type to represent our data. This data is stored in a separate worksheet tab labeled 'CHART'.

>*P.S. The hypotheses and visualizations formulated were still at a foundational level as this was yet the initial stages of the "Data Scientist" course pathway.*






## Survey Details
The survey aims to gather information from respondents on the following details:

• location and settlement classification,

• their enjoyment of studying or learning,

• preferred learning materials,

• average daily time spent studying or learning,

• the average expenditure on studying or learning,

• preferred time for studying or learning, and

• the preferred location for studying or learning.



## Visualizations
Afterwards, basic visualizations were made according to:

• A stacked column illustrates the "Distribution of Enjoyment of Studying/Learning" along with settlement classification composition.

• Pie Chart Representing Preferred Times of the Day: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Late-night

• A bar graph showing the average hours spent per day in the morning, afternoon, evening, and late-night.

• Another bar chart for the preferred study locations.

• Additional bar graphs for the average spending on preferred study materials.

## Results and Discussion

• In total, 19 individuals from urban areas and 15 from rural areas reported enjoying studying or learning, representing a distribution of 56% and 44%, respectively.

• Most respondents indicated that their preferred time for studying or learning is in the morning.

• On average, respondents spend approximately 1.80 hours daily on studying or learning.

• The preferred location for studying or learning is at home.

• The average expenditure on studying/learning overall is "₱783.67".
