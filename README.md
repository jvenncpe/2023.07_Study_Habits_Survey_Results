# Study Habits Survey Results

Capstone project output from "SP201 Essential Excel Skills for Data Preparation and Analysis"
facilitated by Project SPARTA from Development Academy of the Philippines.

The course expects us to craft professional data visualizations and summaries using a variety of Excel functions for a strong and impactful presentation.

## Activity
In our final capstone, we were tasked with creating a chart to visually represent the results of our hypothesis testing. In my case, the specifics about the hypothesis testing can be located in the Week 4 Excel file. 
Following this, we'll determine the most fitting chart type for our data, housed within a separate worksheet titled 'CHART'.

>*P.S. The visualizations and hypotheses formulated were still at a foundational level as this was yet the initial stages of the course.*






## Survey Details
The survey aims to gather information from respondents on the following details:

• location and settlement classification,

• their enjoyment of studying or learning,

• preferred learning materials,

• average daily time spent studying or learning,

• the average expenditure on studying or learning,

• preferred time for studying or learning, and

• the preferred location for studying or learning.



## Visualizations
Afterwards, basic visualizations were made according to:

• A stacked column illustrates the "Distribution of Enjoyment of Studying/Learning" along with settlement classification composition.

• Pie Chart Representing Preferred Times of the Day: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Late-night

• A bar graph showing the average hours spent per day in the morning, afternoon, evening, and late-night.

• Another bar chart for the preferred study locations.

• Additional bar graphs for the average spending on preferred study materials.

• Most respondents indicated that their preferred time for studying or learning is in the morning.

• On average, respondents spend approximately 1.80 hours daily on studying or learning.

• The preferred location for studying or learning is at home.

• The average expenditure on studying/learning overall is "₱783.67".
